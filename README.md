🌟🌟🌟 MY REPO'S ✨✨✨
- My Repo's contain a lot of work, from even before my B.Tech Projects, many are based on old concepts, applications with some novelty or innovation of my own, but do keep in mind many are trials, incomplete or failed attempts of merging two technologies in a project, or creating an application in itself, their are even some small projects I did just to gain experiance that do not contain any novelty at all.

- Apart From this you can expect to find documents, achievements, reports, designs, forgive me for any mis-spells or technical errors, was never a fan of rushing things so much, that collages force us too, [I have slight traces of being a perfectionist].

- NOTE: All the work will take sometime for me to move on GitHub, cause have recently got into Git and Stuff, so will be pushing stuff onto here from my Hard drives as and when I am free. So jsut giving you guys a Heads-up that The Reps may look empty for sometime, as I make them visible only when im completed entirely with a repo.

THANKS FOR BEING HERE AND UNDERSTANDING !!! GO THROUGH AND EXPLORE MY REPO, HOPE YOU GET AN IDEA FOR YOUR NEXT PROJECT LOOKING AT MINE, GOOD LUCK !!! 🚀 🔥🔥🔥
AND IF YOU'RE IN HR TRYING TO ASSESS MY PROFILE FOR A JOB, PLZ PUT IN A GOOD WORD WITH YOUR BOSS MATE !!! 😎 I'LL OWE U ONE 🙌.
